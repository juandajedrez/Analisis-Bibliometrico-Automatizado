  abstract={Chest computed tomography (CT) at inspiration is often complemented by an expiratory CT to identify peripheral airways disease. Additionally, co-registered inspiratory-expiratory volumes can be used to derive various markers of lung function. Expiratory CT scans, however, may not be acquired due to dose or scan time considerations or may be inadequate due to motion or insufficient exhale; leading to a missed opportunity to evaluate underlying small airways disease. Here, we propose LungViT– a generative adversarial learning approach using hierarchical vision transformers for translating inspiratory CT intensities to corresponding expiratory CT intensities. LungViT addresses several limitations of the traditional generative models including slicewise discontinuities, limited size of generated volumes, and their inability to model texture transfer at volumetric level. We propose a shifted-window hierarchical vision transformer architecture with squeeze-and-excitation decoder blocks for modeling dependencies between features. We also propose a multiview texture similarity distance metric for texture and style transfer in 3D. To incorporate global information into the training process and refine the output of our model, we use ensemble cascading. LungViT is able to generate large 3D volumes of size  $320\times 320\times320$ . We train and validate our model using a diverse cohort of 1500 subjects with varying disease severity. To assess model generalizability beyond the development set biases, we evaluate our model on an out-of-distribution external validation set of 200 subjects. Clinical validation on internal and external testing sets shows that synthetic volumes could be reliably adopted for deriving clinical endpoints of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

  abstract={The identification of the disease of paddy leaves is a very critical issue, as it is quite hard with the naked eye, and even professionals like agricultural scientists may make mistakes in this regard. This is a problem that our approach, which we undertake in this paper, may remedy. In this paper, we present deep learning with the use of generative adversarial networks in leaf disease diagnosis using artificial intelligence. In our experiment, we used a dataset with 12,880 paddy leaf images produced by Cycle GAN, displaying five main disease classifications. GANs should be taken into consideration while data augmentation is performed to prevent overfitting, while a GAN design that uses two networks-a Generator and a Discriminator-is suggested. The generator was taught to produce samples of data that are comparable to the original data. The deep learning proposed approach can be regarded as an important tool for early disease identification in the detection and classification of paddy leaf diseases.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach to enhance cyber-security in distribution systems with a high penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) by addressing False Data Injection Attacks (FDIA). The proposed mitigation response strategy leverages Deep Generative Models (DGM), specifically the integration of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), termed VAEGAN. This method effectively captures the underlying distribution of measurements, allowing the generation of secure measurements to replace those compromised by FDIA. The strength of the proposed model lies in its ability to comprehend the complexities of real data distribution, particularly grid events associated with DER integration, facilitated by a robust loss function. The paper rigorously assesses the model’s performance using Discrete Fréchet Distance (DFD) for measurement generation and evaluates errors induced by various FDIA types across case studies using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrate a substantial reduction in errors ranging from 94.38% to 99.99% for constant attacks and 91.74% to 99.99% for transient attacks, affirming the efficacy of the proposed VAEGAN in mitigating the impact of FDIA on the system.},

  abstract={In rapidly urbanizing cities with increasing populations, the challenges of managing traffic are becoming more pressing, highlighting the need for advanced technologies. The Advanced Intelligent Traffic Management System (AITMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to address the persistent challenges of traffic congestion, poor traffic management, and air pollution in densely populated urban areas. Current traffic management systems often rely on static algorithms and predetermined signal timings, which are insufficient to handle dynamic and unpredictable traffic patterns. This results in prolonged travel times, increased fuel consumption, and elevated levels of air pollution, posing serious threats to public health and environmental sustainability. AITMS integrates physical and digital infrastructures, leveraging Generative AI for real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By incorporating sensors, IoT devices, and advanced data analytics, the system can predict traffic flow, optimize signal timings, and recommend alternate routes. It also communicates with connected vehicles to provide real-time updates. The incorporation of Generative AI enables the AITMS to continually adapt and learn from new data inputs and trends, ensuring sustainability and scalability in urban transportation. AITMS is an innovative framework enhanced by Generative AI, aimed at revolutionizing urban traffic management in smart cities. Similar frameworks demonstrate promising outcomes, including improved traffic management, reduced congestion, and enhanced driver safety. AITMS aims to transform urban transportation, elevate residents' quality of life, and foster more sustainable and resilient cities amidst urbanization challenges.},

  abstract={Availability of advanced sensors and computing can enable early detection of failure due to DC Arc faults in largescale solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems. The variations in current and voltage due to arcing are difficult to detect which may lead to permanent reduction of power generated by PV systems. In this work, fast detection and classification of DC Arc fault is demonstrated using a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN). Two different architectures of CGAN are compared for performance evaluation to accurately identify the DC Arc and classify. The CGAN network generates a signal indicating a distribution probability based on voltage and current measurements at the inverter location of the PV system. The performance of the proposed CGAN architecture is evaluated using rolling precision scoring on backcasted datasets and compared with a baseline. The proposed architecture demonstrates high precision in detecting and classifying DC Arc faults in a 1 MW solar PV system modeled using a real time simulator.},

  abstract={Multimodal CT scans, including non-contrast CT, CT perfusion, and CT angiography, are widely used in acute stroke diagnosis and therapeutic planning. While each imaging modality has its advantage in brain cross-sectional feature visualizations, the varying image resolution of different modalities hinders the ability of the radiologist to discern consistent but subtle suspicious findings. Besides, higher image quality requires a high radiation dose, leading to increases in health risks such as cataract formation and cancer induction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method Transfer-GAN that utilizes generative adversarial networks and transfer learning to improve multimodal CT image resolution and to lower the necessary radiation exposure. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that transfer learning from multimodal CT provides substantial visualization and quantity enhancement compare to the training without learning the prior knowledge.},

  abstract={With the development of convolutional neural network, deep learning has shown its success for retinal disease detection from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. However, deep learning often relies on large scale labelled data for training, which is oftentimes challenging especially for disease with low occurrence. Moreover, a deep learning system trained from data-set with one or a few diseases is unable to detect other unseen diseases, which limits the practical usage of the system in disease screening. To address the limitation, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework termed Sparsity-constrained Generative Adversarial Network (Sparse-GAN) for disease screening where only healthy data are available in the training set. The contributions of Sparse-GAN are two-folds: 1) The proposed Sparse-GAN predicts the anomalies in latent space rather than image-level; 2) Sparse-GAN is constrained by a novel Sparsity Regularization Net. Furthermore, in light of the role of lesions for disease screening, we present to leverage on an anomaly activation map to show the heatmap of lesions. We evaluate our proposed Sparse-GAN on a publicly available dataset, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of different modalities can provide complementary information for clinical diagnosis, but whole modalities are often costly to access. Most existing methods only focus on synthesizing missing images between two modalities, which limits their robustness and efficiency when multiple modalities are missing. To address this problem, we propose a multi-modality generative adversarial network (MGAN) to synthesize three high-quality MR modalities (FLAIR, T1 and T1ce) from one MR modality T2 simultaneously. The experimental results show that the quality of the synthesized images by our proposed methods is better than the one synthesized by the baseline model, pix2pix. Besides, for MR brain image synthesis, it is important to preserve the critical tumor information in the generated modalities, so we further introduce a multi-modality tumor consistency loss to MGAN, called TC-MGAN. We use the synthesized modalities by TC-MGAN to boost the tumor segmentation accuracy, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract={Traditional segmentation methods are annotation-free but usually produce unsatisfactory results. The latest leading deep learning methods improve the results but require expensive and time-consuming pixel-level manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel method based on self-supervision and generative adversarial network (GAN), which has high performance and requires no manual annotations. First, we perform traditional segmentation methods to obtain coarse segmentation. Then, we use GAN to generate a synthetic image, on which the image foreground is pixel-to-pixel corresponding to the coarse segmentation. Finally, we train the segmentation model with the data pairs of synthetic images and coarse segmentations. We evaluate our method on two types of segmentation tasks, including red blood cell (RBC) segmentation on microscope images and vessel segmentation on digital subtraction angiographies (DSA). The results show that our annotation-free method provides a considerable improvement over the traditional methods and achieves comparable accuracies with fully supervised methods.},

Previously, supervised adversarial approaches have been suggested for the correction of MR motion artifacts. However, these approaches suffer from the limitation of required paired co-registered datasets for training which are often hard or impossible to acquire. Building upon our previous work, we introduce a new adversarial framework with a new generator architecture and loss function for the unsupervised correction of severe rigid motion artifacts in the brain region. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with other supervised and unsupervised translation approaches showcase the enhanced performance of the introduced framework.},

  abstract={Data augmentation is a popular technique with which new dataset samples are artificially synthesized to the end of assisting training of learning-based algorithms and avoiding overfitting. Methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently rekindled interest in research on new techniques for data augmentation. With the current paper we propose a new GAN-based model for data augmentation, comprising a suitable Markov random field-based spatial constraint that encourages synthesis of spatially smooth outputs. Oriented towards use with medical imaging sets where a localization/segmentation annotation is available, our model can simultaneously also produce artificial annotations. We gauge performance numerically by measuring performance through U-Net trained to detect cells on microscopy images, by taking into account the produced augmented dataset. Numerical trials, as well as qualitative results validate the contribution of our model.},

  abstract={Deep learning is a popular and powerful tool in computed tomography (CT) image processing such as organ segmentation, but its requirement of large training datasets remains a challenge. Even though there is a large anatomical variability for children during their growth, the training datasets for pediatric CT scans are especially hard to obtain due to risks of radiation to children. In this paper, we propose a method to conditionally synthesize realistic pediatric CT images using a new auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN) architecture by taking age information into account. The proposed network generated age-conditioned high-resolution CT images to enrich pediatric training datasets.},

  abstract={The slice thickness of MR imaging may remarkably degrade the clarity of 3D lesion images within through-plane slices (coronal or sagittal views) so as to influence the performance of lesion characterization. To alleviate the problem, we propose an end-to-end super-resolution and self-attention framework based on Generative adversarial networks (GAN) for improving the malignancy characterization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Specifically, a super-resolution subnetwork is designed to enhance the low-resolution patches of coronal or sagittal views based on the high resolution patches of the axial view, and then the enhanced patches are fed into the classification subnetwork for malignancy characterization. Furthermore, a self-attention mechanism is utilized to extract multi-level features for better super-resolution and lesion characterization. Experimental results of clinical HCCs demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with conventional CNN-based methods and show the potential in clinical practice.},

  pages={1971-1974},
  abstract={Optical coherence tomography (OCT) plays an important role in retinal disease screening. Traditional classification-based screening methods require complicated annotation works. Due to the difficulty of collecting abnormal samples, some anomaly detection methods have been applied to screen retinal lesions only based on normal samples. However, most existing anomaly detection methods are time consuming and easily misjudging abnormal OCT images with implicit lesions like small drusen. To solve these problems, we propose a memory-augmented anomaly generative adversarial network (MA-GAN) for retinal OCT screening. Within the generator, we establish a memory module to enhance the detail expressing abilities of typical OCT normal patterns. Meanwhile, the discriminator of MA-GAN is decomposed orthogonally so that it has the encoding ability simultaneously. As a result, the abnormal image can be screened by the greater difference in the distribution of pixels and features between the original image and its reconstructed image. The model trained with 13000 normal OCT images reaches 0.875 AUC on the test set of 2000 normal images and 1000 anomalous images. And the inference time only takes 35 milliseconds for each image. Compared to other anomaly detection methods, our MA-GAN has the advantages in model accuracy and computation time for retinal OCT screening.},

  abstract={Computer-Aided-Diagnosis (CADx) systems assist radiologists with identifying and classifying potentially malignant pulmonary nodules on chest CT scans using morphology and texture-based (radiomic) features. However, radiomic features are sensitive to differences in acquisitions due to variations in dose levels and slice thickness. This study investigates the feasibility of generating a normalized scan from heterogeneous CT scans as input. We obtained projection data from 40 low-dose chest CT scans, simulating acquisitions at 10%, 25% and 50% dose and reconstructing the scans at 1.0mm and 2.0mm slice thickness. A 3D generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to simultaneously normalize reduced dose, thick slice (2.0mm) images to normal dose (100%), thinner slice (1.0mm) images. We evaluated the normalized image quality using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Our GAN improved perceptual similarity by 35%, compared to a baseline CNN method. Our analysis also shows that the GAN-based approach led to a significantly smaller error (p-value < 0.05) in nine studied radiomic features. These results indicated that GANs could be used to normalize heterogeneous CT images and reduce the variability in radiomic feature values.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to detect outage events in partially observable distribution systems by capturing the changes in smart meters' (SMs) data distribution. To achieve this, first, a breadth-first search (BFS)-based mechanism is proposed to decompose the network into a set of zones that maximize outage location information in partially observable systems. Then, using SM data in each zone, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed to implicitly extract the temporal-spatial behavior in normal conditions in an unsupervised fashion. After training, an anomaly scoring technique is leveraged to determine if real-time measurements indicate an outage event in the zone. Finally, to infer the location of the outage events in a multi-zone network, a zone coordination process is proposed to take into account the interdependencies of intersecting zones. We have provided analytical guarantees of performance for our algorithm using the concept of entropy, which is leveraged to quantify outage location information in multi-zone grids. The proposed method has been tested and verified on distribution feeder models with real SM data.},

  abstract={Failure prognostics is the process of predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of machine components, which is vital for the predictive maintenance of industrial machinery. This paper presents a new deep learning approach for failure prognostics of rolling element bearings based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictor trained simultaneously within a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The LSTM predictor takes the current and past observations of a well-defined health index as an input, uses those to forecast the future degradation trajectory, and then derives the RUL. Our proposed approach has three unique features: (1) Defining the bearing failure threshold by adopting an International Organization of Standardization (ISO) standard, making the approach industry-relevant; (2) Employing a GAN-based data augmentation technique to improve the accuracy and robustness of RUL prediction in cases where the deep learning model has access to only a small amount of training data; (3) Integrating the training process of the LSTM predictor within the GAN architecture. A joint training approach is utilized to ensure that the LSTM predictor model learns both the original and artificially generated data to capture the degradation trajectories. We utilize a publicly available accelerated run-to-failure dataset of rolling element bearings to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Results of a five-fold cross-validation study show that the integration of the LSTM predictor with GAN helps to decrease the average RUL prediction error by 29% over a simple LSTM model without GAN implementation.},

  abstract={Real-time Transient Stability Assessment (TSA) is essential for prompt control decisions that lead to a stable power system. With the wide deployment of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) in power grids, data-driven TSA approaches, particularly those based on machine learning (ML) techniques, have become increasingly relevant in recent years. Within cycles, the well-trained ML-based TSA classifiers enable accurately assessing the post-fault transient stability of a power system. However, events that lead to transient instability are rare. Hence, the training datasets used by ML-based classifiers are highly imbalanced, challenging the accuracy of these methods. An imbalanced dataset, where the number of unstable samples is significantly lower than the number of stable samples, will result in an inaccurate and biased classifier. To address the problem of imbalanced data, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to generate synthetic unstable datasets by learning from the real unstable transient data, with a goal to balance the distribution of the stable and unstable datasets. To learn the spatial and temporal correlations of the PMU data, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and the correlation loss are utilized to construct the GAN model. Comparison with other data resampling methods demonstrates that the developed GAN model addresses the problem of an imbalanced training dataset, and results in more accurate machine learning-based algorithms for TSA.},

To address this challenge, we developed a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach to assist the design of DRA structures.

A paired dataset of geometric shapes and S11 parameter was fed into the GAN model to train the neural network.

The final model is capable of generating new DRA structures according to the desired S11 parameter.},

However, acquiring multiple scans incurs increased radiation dose, time, and cost, and may not be possible in many cases, thus restricting the applicability of registration-based biomechanics. We propose a generative adversarial learning approach for estimating local tissue expansion directly from a single CT scan. The proposed framework was trained and evaluated on 2500 subjects from the SPIROMICS cohort. Once trained, the framework can be used as a registration-free method for predicting local tissue expansion. We evaluated model performance across varying degrees of disease severity and compared its performance with two image-to-image translation frameworks – UNet and Pix2Pix. Our model achieved an overall PSNR of 18.95 decibels, SSIM of 0.840, and Spearman’s correlation of 0.61 at a high spatial resolution of 1mm3.},

  abstract={Real active distribution networks with associated smart meter (SM) data are critical for power researchers. However, it is practically difficult for researchers to obtain such comprehensive datasets from utilities due to privacy concerns. To bridge this gap, an implicit generative model with Wasserstein GAN objectives, namely unbalanced graph generative adversarial network (UG-GAN), is designed to generate synthetic three-phase unbalanced active distribution system connectivity. The basic idea is to learn the distribution of random walks both over a real-world system and across each phase of line segments, capturing the underlying local properties of an individual real-world distribution network and generating specific synthetic networks accordingly. Then, to create a comprehensive synthetic test case, a network correction and extension process is proposed to obtain time-series nodal demands and standard distribution grid components with realistic parameters, including distributed energy resources (DERs) and capacitor banks. A Midwest distribution system with 1-year SM data has been utilized to validate the performance of our method. Case studies with several power applications demonstrate that synthetic active networks generated by the proposed framework can mimic almost all features of real-world networks while avoiding the disclosure of confidential information.},
